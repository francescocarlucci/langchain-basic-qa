Interacting with custom content is one of the most popular and powerful usage of LLMs and AI systems,
thanks to the vast amount of application opportunities.

Imagine having a virtual assistant capable of instantly summarizing documents for you, going over long
email threads and only extracting the most relevant and useful information, monitoring your team
communication and early detecting any problem out there. Or maybe you wanna go over a contract
and check for hiccups or contradictions? These and many more things are possible using LangChain,
and this is what we built in this tutorial.

    - Browse [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/francescocarlucci/langchain-basic-qa/blob/main/app.py) and make sure you understand it.

    - Tired of the OpenAI LLM? Try to plug in another model from the many others supported by LangChain.
    - Wanna work with other file formats? You can use txt, md, csv and even HTML usgin other [document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/).

This is a simplified imlementation of a proper QA system. It works well with short documents,
email threads, blog posts, contracts, but it will fail if you provide big documents like books
and big databases. For simplicity, the PDF is loaded as vector using an in-memory storage
(DocArrayInMemorySearch), but in other tutorials we will see how to handle big documents or
even multiple files using proper vector databases, indexing and text-splitting. But remember,
sizing an application for his purpose is also an important skill, to avoid over-complicating
system and wasting processing and financial resources.
